### Hello, I'm @3O11.

- I'm a Computer Science student interested in Computer Graphics and all
other things related to Computer Science in general.

- I don't yet have much experience, but I'm always trying my best to get
better.

- I plan to work on extending the [canvas library](https://github.com/3O11/canvas) in my free time.
The repository contains (or will contain) a list of my plans in the README.

- Here is a look at the languages that I use most often:

- And here are my GitHub stats. It's nothing to celebrate just yet, but it will hopefully get better in the future.
